# Multi-ray-localization

Multi ray localization on OpenSfM or OpenDroneMap

This code is an algorithm that extracts the relative position of the coordinates of interest in a group form.

As a constraint, the coordinates of the input must form groups. And the way it receives json as input depends on OpenSfm.
